# daily-planner-app
Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.


## Notes:
I accidently saved and commited dozens of messages onto another repo thinking I was doing it to this repo, so I will list the messages of some of the commits I made onto here:

-
-
-
- debugged the code ...
- added if statement to compare hours for past, present, future. then added css to change background colour
